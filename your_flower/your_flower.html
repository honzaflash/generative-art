        If mood is toggled on, raising your eyebrows will lighten the flower up.

      <h3>About This Project</h3>
      <p>
        Your_Flower is inspired by the idea of gifting flowers.
        Flowers can be beautiful but the real ones can also be expensive.
        In this project I attempted to make a generator that takes an image
        of you and presents a beautiful virtual abstract flower generated based on
        your unique face features.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is three main kinds of flowers you can get - Rose, Daisy and Maurer. 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Rose</b> is made up of layers of concentric closed curves
            that are deformed based on Perlin noise.</li>
          <li><b>Daisy</b> is made up of petals that are drawn around a circle.</li>
          <li>And <b>Maurer</b> is plotted walk of a rose curve
          (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurer_rose" target="_blank">Maurer Rose</a> on wikipedia).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        After you press 'G' image from the webcam is sent to the
        Face⁺⁺ API with a request for analysis. Received data is then
        combined into three seeds that are then used in to determine
        properties of flowers like color, jitter strength, counts of petals, etc.
        In addition real-time tracking is used to interactively
        manipulate the generated flower slightly based on eyeborw height. &MediumSpace; ( ͝סּ ͜ʖ͡סּ) &MediumSpace; ( •̀ ᴗ •́ )
      </p>
      <p>
        The technologies I am using:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> 
            - Creative coding library in JavaScript that makes drawing very easy.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr" target="_blank">clmtrackr</a> 
            - Real-time tracking JavaScript library.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.faceplusplus.com/face-detection/" target="_blank">Face⁺⁺</a> 
            - Facial recognition API, with detailed tracking information.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortcomings: Sadly the tracking technology is not as precise and consistent
        to grant the same flower to a single person every time - which was
        kind of the plan originally. This way at least you can get more different flowers
        that you know are still generated based on <b>your</b> lovely face.
